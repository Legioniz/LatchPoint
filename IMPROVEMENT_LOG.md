## 2026-11-10 — Player movement regression coverage

**Objective:** establish a deterministic regression baseline for the existing CharacterBody2D controller without changing the unconfirmed game design.

- Extended `tests/physics_smoke_test.gd` to instantiate the actual `res://Scene/player.tscn` against a temporary static floor fixture.
- Simulated the existing `ui_right` and `ui_accept` actions with Godot's Input singleton and synchronized assertions to completed physics callbacks.
- The first CI attempt exposed a one-tick overrun in a timer-based wait (180 px/s observed versus 150 px/s expected at 60 Hz). A second attempt using the `physics_frame` signal retained the same off-by-one because that signal fires before node callbacks. The final helper is a persistent test-only physics waiter at physics priority 100; it counts exact ticks after the player's default-priority callback and is reused between assertions to avoid creating a new frame boundary.
- Added assertions for configured horizontal acceleration, friction after release, grounded jump velocity, gravity increasing vertical velocity, and rejection of a second jump while airborne.
- Kept the existing scene-load, floor-landing, and floor/wall/ceiling probe checks intact.
- No shipping gameplay script, scene, asset, project setting, input map, or dependency was changed. The test fixture is transient and exists only in the smoke-test process.
- This completes the current-player-movement baseline slice of the broader deterministic physics QA task; corners, slopes, one-way/moving platforms, tunneling, masks, and respawn overlap remain open.

**Verification**
- Local Godot execution: not run; no Godot executable is installed in this environment.
- Godot 4.7.2 GitHub Actions validation: pending the feature-branch push.
- Manual in-game feel/visual testing: not performed. The core gameplay loop and design pillars remain unconfirmed.
- Performance: no runtime profiling performed because this is test-only code and no runtime optimization was made.
- ML: not used; deterministic input simulation is ordinary scripted testing, not machine learning.

**Status:** persistent waiter correction committed after two CI runs exposed frame-boundary over-counting; final CI validation is pending.

**Research:** Godot 4.7 CharacterBody2D, Input, and SceneTree documentation; Godot demo-project platformer and Celeste developer notes. See `RESEARCH_REGISTER.md`.

**Branch:** `feature/player-movement-regression-tests` (dependent on the open foundation/window/audio documentation PR chain).
